## Rule Logic & AI Prompts

### Rule Layer
- **Role relevance:**
  - Decision-makers (e.g., CEO, Founder) get +20 points.
  - Influencers (e.g., Manager, Lead) get +10 points.
- **Industry/Use Case Match:**
  - If prospect's industry/company matches ideal use cases, +20 points.
  - Partial match, +10 points.
- **Data Completeness:**
  - All required fields present, +10 points.

### AI Layer (Gemini)
- For each prospect, the following prompt is sent to Gemini:
  ```
  Prospect: {prospect JSON}
  Offer: {product JSON}
  Classify intent (High/Medium/Low) and explain in 1â€“2 sentences. Only respond in this format:
  Intent: <High|Medium|Low>
  Explanation: <your explanation>
  ```
- **Intent Scoring:**
  - High: +50 points
  - Medium: +30 points
  - Low: +10 points

### Output
- Each prospect gets:
  - `rule_layer_score`: Score from rule logic
  - `ai_layer`: AI intent, explanation, and score
  - `total_score`: Sum of rule and AI scores

## Notes
- Results are available in both JSON and downloadable CSV format.
- Requires a valid Google GenAI API key.
